Something keeps stirring inside us to work together. I'm not sure what it is, but Whitney and I continue to want to do something together so that we can make a difference in this world.

What kind of difference is that? I'm not sure and I don't think either of us know.

What we do know is that we want to share our story and our lives to anyone that might be able to benefit from it. Maybe not in tangible ways, but in emotional ways that will help others process life a little bit better and come to know God and also how He can change your life.

We're certainly not perfect. We're also not vague. Our mouths try to speak the truth, honest, and the hard things no one wants to hear. Because that's who we are.

I feel like society today is overwhelmed by the lack of love, personality in others, and the ability to make a difference. There are so many ways to be "creative" that we \[as a culture] have forgotten how to love each other, trust one another, and be human.

Instead, there are plenty of other "important" things, concepts, or activities we get involved in which come in between families and friends.

I'm not sure where this blog will go. It's 2018 and we've been doing things online since 2013.

We've quit. We've started again. We've stayed up until 2am or later multiple months in a row and we've given up. There are so many opportunities we've missed because we haven't pushed through and supported each other along the way.

I can't wait to finalize our "about us" to talk about the enormous things that we have gone through and how we cannot understand what keeps us together at times. 

Hopefully this blog is full of hope, love, and encouragement to get you through your next day.

Thanks for reading :)
